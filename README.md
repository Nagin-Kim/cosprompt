# Consprompt: Exploiting Contrastive Samples for Few-Shot Prompt Learning 
The prompt has become an effective linguistic tool for utilizing
pre-trained language models. However, in few-shot scenarios, subtle changes in the prompt’s design always make the
result widely different, and the prompt learning methods
also easy to overfit the limited samples. To alleviate
this, we explore utilizing suitable contrastive samples and
multi-degree contrastive learning methods to improve the robustness of the prompt’s representation. Therefore, the proposed
Consprompt, combined with the prompt encoding network, contrastive sampling modules, and contrastive scoring modules,
is introduced to realize differential contrastive learning.
